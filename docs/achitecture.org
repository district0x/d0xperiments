Idea for a new d0x dapps arch

** Contracts side
Every dapp contains a contract called FactsDb, which only purpose is to log/emit Datomic like facts [e a v] like :

#+BEGIN_SRC solidity
event Fact(uint indexed entity, string indexed attribute, string indexed  val, bool add);
event Fact(uint indexed entity, string indexed attribute, uint indexed    val, bool add);
event Fact(uint indexed entity, string indexed attribute, address indexed val, bool add);
// ... more types here

function transactString(uint entity, string attribute, string val)
external
onlyAllowed
{
   emit Fact(entity, attribute, val, true);
}

function removeString(uint entity, string attribute, string val)
external
onlyAllowed
{
   emit Fact(entity, attribute, val, false);
}
// ... more fns for more types here
#+END_SRC

This approach centralizes logs and makes some stuff easier for dapps ui part because :

- All you need to do is add a filter for the FactsDb address and the topics above
- You can evolve other contracs with more events without the need of upgrading FactsDb contract (no memefactory Registry.sol upgrade problem)
- Since you can optionally index by e,a or v you can add special filters (subscribe) to any of those

*** Calculating entity ids

- reg-entry -> reg-entry/address
- tokens    -> keccak256("token/id", 20)

** Indexer and pre built indexes

If we see our FactsDb logs in the blockchain as our immutable, distributed dapp datoms, now we have the problem of indexing them to give a fast user experience.
I think a natural fit for indexing datoms is Datascript DB.

We can create a generic component (it can run on browser and node), lets call it syncer, with the only purpose of given a eth address and datascript schema, transact all FactsDb datoms inside a Datascript db.
Since datascript db is serializable we can dump it on local storage in browser or a edn file in server so when we start from scratch we can just re synchronize from last seen block (since blockchain is immutable).

With this syncer component the only thing needed to run the application is browser UI app (no need for server), which is much more decentralized.

Because we can run the syncer on a server for free with a main, we can run a copy on some servers that keep building this indexes so when new user first loads the app it can try to reach a server and retrieve a already indexed Datascript, instead of starting from a empty one, which should make app start much faster.

** UI

We can keep using all our district0x component, but instead of district-ui-graphql we can use something like re-posh, which has the same idea of subscribing with queries
but against a Datascript db, using datalog and pull instead of graphql.

** Nice properties

- Much closer to a fully decentralized app
- Can use apps (at least for browsing) offline
- No need for custom server implementation, syncer can be a generic component
- Less complex than our current UI architecture (graphql on client/server, data normalization, etc)
- Since arch is much simpler it should be easier to attract other developers to collaborate with d0x

** Notes

I'm not sure how well this scale in super big applications, the only problem I see are dapps with so many datoms that :
- is hard to keep the entire index on client
- it takes a lot to download index image first time

Non of those looks to me as big problems now since bandwidth and clients are super powerful and keep improving everyday,
also there are not a lot of dapps users now, so I think is better to be able to deliver a bigger variety of applications faster than to
try to support super big applications.

I also think it is aligned and also push in the direction of the ultimate district0x goal that is to create a tool for non technical users
to be able to create districts.
